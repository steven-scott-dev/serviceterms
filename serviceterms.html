✅ What to Check / Include If You Propose Using a Bot

If you want to request / propose usage of the API for a bot (maybe to TokPortal or to yourself internally), here are parts you must ensure / clarify, to stay legal & safe:

Confirm that TokPortal allows automation / bots / scripts via their API. Sometimes “API available for automation” is mentioned — but the Terms may ban certain kinds of bot-behavior.

Make sure your bot complies with their policies: don’t generate spam, violate content rules, fake engagement, violate TikTok’s ToS.

Make sure you store and use your API Key securely; don’t share it in public repos.

Make sure your usage is within rate limits / quotas.

Include consent / notice to users if you collect any data via bot or store personal info.

Be ready to disable or modify bot usage if TokPortal or TikTok changes their rules.</div>
