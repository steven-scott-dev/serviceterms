Definitions

TokPortal

Account Manager (“AM”) is someone who offers account / video creation services. 
TokPortal

Client is the one who pays and requests said services. 
TokPortal

What TokPortal Does Not Do

They are a marketplace only. They connect Clients & Account Managers; they don’t perform the missions themselves. 
TokPortal

TokPortal

Account Registration / Eligibility

AMs must be 18+ years old. 
TokPortal

You must provide accurate info, maintain credentials and identity info, business registration if required. 
TokPortal

Listings / Mission Rules

When you create a listing, you specify deliverables. When an AM accepts it, it’s binding. 
TokPortal

The work should be done with reasonable skill and care and comply with laws, social-media platform rules, etc. That means if your bot causes content that violates TikTok’s ToS, you’re responsible. 
TokPortal

Payments / Fees

TokPortal takes a 60% commission from orders; AMs get 40%. 
TokPortal

They use payment providers (Stripe) and hold funds in escrow until mission completion. 
TokPortal

Intellectual Property

Once a mission is fully paid, the client owns the deliverables (like videos, etc.), except where otherwise agreed. 
TokPortal

TokPortal and its licensors still own their software, brand, etc. You can’t claim you own TokPortal’s IP. 
TokPortal

Content & Conduct

You can’t upload / request / facilitate content that’s illegal, infringing, defamatory, hateful, etc. 
TokPortal

The responsibility is on you to ensure compliance with TikTok’s rules and laws. If you break them, you’ll be held accountable. 
TokPortal

Limitation of Liability & Indemnification

TokPortal limits their liability to the greater of €100 or total fees paid by the Client in the previous 12 months. 
TokPortal

You (user) must indemnify TokPortal against claims that arise from your breach of the terms. 
TokPortal

Termination

They can suspend or terminate your access for violations, fraud, or if you misuse the platform. 
TokPortal

Updates & Governing Law

They can change the Terms. If you keep using the service after changes, that means you accept them.

TokPortal

✅ What to Check / Include If You Propose Using a Bot

If you want to request / propose usage of the API for a bot (maybe to TokPortal or to yourself internally), here are parts you must ensure / clarify, to stay legal & safe:

Confirm that TokPortal allows automation / bots / scripts via their API. Sometimes “API available for automation” is mentioned — but the Terms may ban certain kinds of bot-behavior.

Make sure your bot complies with their policies: don’t generate spam, violate content rules, fake engagement, violate TikTok’s ToS.

Make sure you store and use your API Key securely; don’t share it in public repos.

Make sure your usage is within rate limits / quotas.

Include consent / notice to users if you collect any data via bot or store personal info.

Be ready to disable or modify bot usage if TokPortal or TikTok changes their rules.</div>
